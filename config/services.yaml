# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.
# Files in the packages/ subdirectory configure your dependencies.

# Put parameters here that don't need to change on each machine where the app is deployed
# https://symfony.com/doc/current/best_practices/configuration.html#application-related-configuration
parameters:

services:
    # default configuration for services in *this* file
    _defaults:
        autowire: false      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
        autoconfigure: false # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.
        public: true         # Allows optimizing the container by removing unused services; this also means
                             # fetching services directly from the container via $container->get() won't work.
                             # The best practice is to be explicit about your dependencies anyway.

    # add more service definitions when explicit configuration is needed
    # please note that last definitions always *replace* previous ones
